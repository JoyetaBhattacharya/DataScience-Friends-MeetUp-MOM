*Mom for the meeting on 18th April 2020*

1. Covert Column type into appropriate data types so we can capture the null values. 
2. Covid-19 cases distribution based on Nationality --- change to bar plot.
3. Apply stack plot for top 20 states analysis
sample code:
phone_brand_gender_report_group.plot.bar(stacked=True)
plt.xlabel("Types of brands")
plt.ylabel("Number of users")
plt.title("Distribution of Male & Female users across Phone Brands")

4) Which Government is there in State
5) Source of Infection 
6) Age group 
7) When the first patient surface & in the number of days patient is getting doubled ... Finding the spread rate and prediction of the situation on 1st May 2020.
8)The last two weeks trend of death and new cases. 
9)Ratio chart of hospitalization, recovery and death with creating new data frame 
10)District wise count of hospitalization, recovery and death
11)Day wise count of hospitalization, recovery and death
 
Few codes discussed in meeting 

1. to remove null cells from the data set
data_death_recoveries = data_death_recoveries[~data_death_recoveries['date'].isnull()]

2. Few ages are having age braket like 28-35, replace them 

df['agebracket'].unique()
df["agebracket"].replace({"28-35": "35"}, inplace=True)

*ML- Timeseries in separate notebook*
Dataset to use : https://api.covid19india.org/data.json
1. df_raw_data['statuschangedate'] = df_raw_data['statuschangedate'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
df_raw_data['dateannounced'] = df_raw_data['dateannounced'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
date format
2. Predict new cases in May
